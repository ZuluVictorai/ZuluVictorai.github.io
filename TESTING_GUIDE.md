# Test Procedure Guide

## Step 1: ssh_connection
- to establish ssh connection with remote client, ensure remote client is on before running code.
- first window is to establish ssh connection. input remote client IP address into Host field and complete task.

## Step 2: Testing
 - After connecting to the transceiver a new GUI will open asking the user to input a frequency and select a bandwidth from a predefined selection of bandwidths. 
 - Test 1: Apply a different frequency than what is currently configured to the transceiver, do not change the bandwidth
 - Test 2: Appy a different bandwidth than what is currently configured to the transceiver, do not change the frequency
 - Test 3: Apply a new frequency and bandwidth than what is currently configured to the transceiver.
 - Record all findings
 - Ensure that all predefined bandwidths are tested and that the max and min frequency range is tested.
